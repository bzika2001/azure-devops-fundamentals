## 🎯 Course Goal

> To provide a strong foundation in Azure DevOps so you can confidently manage and support modern software development workflows from planning to deployment.

## 💡 Why Should You Care About DevOps?

**DevOps** is no longer optional — it's the standard for delivering modern software efficiently and reliably.

### 📌 Key Benefits for You and Your Team:
| Value                      | Why It Matters for Delivery                                     |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🚀 Faster Releases          | Shorter delivery cycles mean faster feedback and value delivery |
| ✅ Better Quality            | Automated testing and deployment reduces defects               |
| 🔄 Improved Collaboration   | Dev, QA, and Ops work as one team with shared visibility        |
| 📉 Fewer Incidents          | Continuous Monitoring + CI/CD = Fewer production issues         |
| 📊 Measurable Improvements  | Track lead time, deployment frequency, and failure rate         |

🔑 **Bottom Line:** DevOps isn't just for techies. It’s for **anyone who cares about speed, quality, and happy users.**

---

## 🔹 What is Azure DevOps?

**Azure DevOps** is Microsoft’s all-in-one DevOps platform that helps teams:
- **Plan** work (Agile boards, sprints)
- **Code** together (Git repos)
- **Build and release** (CI/CD pipelines)
- **Test** and manage quality (test plans)
- **Deliver** continuously

🏗️ It’s built for **teams of any size**, supports **any tech stack**, and runs in the **cloud or hybrid**.

🔑 Think of it like a "DevOps command center" with plug-and-play tools.

## 🔹 Why Use Azure DevOps?

| Feature                        | What It Means for Your Projects                                |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌐 Web-Based Access             | No local install — just login and manage everything online       |
| 🔗 Integrated Tools             | No need for 3rd-party plugins — all core functions are built in  |
| 👥 Team Permissions             | Role-based access (Dev, QA, PMs, etc.) with clear boundaries      |
| 📋 Sprint & Task Management     | Built-in Agile planning with support for Scrum and Kanban         |
| 🧪 Manual & Automated Testing   | Supports both exploratory and scripted testing workflows         |
| ⏱️ Real-Time Reporting          | Custom dashboards, queries, and burn-downs for transparency      |

---

## 🔹 Core Components Overview

| Component           | Description                                                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Azure Boards**     | Agile planning: Epics, stories, bugs, Kanban boards, backlogs             |
| **Azure Repos**      | Git-based code versioning with branch policies and pull requests          |
| **Azure Pipelines**  | CI/CD automation for building, testing, and deploying applications        |
| **Azure Test Plans** | Manual and exploratory test case management with traceability             |
| **Azure Artifacts**  | Host and manage versioned packages and dependencies in a private feed     |

🧠 Use only what you need. Azure DevOps is modular — you can plug in just Boards and Pipelines if that’s all you need.

## 🔹 DevOps vs Agile vs CI/CD

| Concept   | What It Really Means                                                           |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agile** | A mindset for delivering value incrementally and adapting to change             |
| **DevOps**| A culture that merges Dev + Ops for smoother delivery and collaboration         |
| **CI/CD** | Automation techniques to integrate, test, and release software continuously      |

🧩 They’re not mutually exclusive — **Agile is how you plan**, **DevOps is how you deliver**, **CI/CD is how you automate**.

---

## 🔹 Azure DevOps Roles – Focus on Delivery Lead

As a **Delivery Lead**, Azure DevOps gives you tools to:
- Visualize team progress (Boards)
- Spot bottlenecks (Dashboards & Queries)
- Monitor build/release stability (Pipelines)
- Drive quality conversations (Test Plans)
- Align Dev and QA timelines (Sprint capacity planning)

💡 Tip: Set up **Delivery Dashboards** to track velocity, burndown, and failed deployments at a glance.

## 🛠 How to Create a Project in Azure DevOps

Setting up your first project is quick and easy.

### ✅ Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Sign in to** [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com)
2. From the landing page, click **"New Project"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Project Name** (e.g., `CustomerPortal-Q3`)
   - **Description** *(optional but useful)*
   - Choose **Visibility**:  
     - `Private` (internal teams only)  
     - `Public` (open to external collaborators)
   - Choose **Version Control**:  
     - `Git` (recommended)  
     - `Team Foundation Version Control` (legacy)
   - Choose **Work Item Process**:  
     - `Agile`, `Scrum`, `CMMI` *(start with Agile or Scrum)*

4. Click **Create**

🎉 You now have:
- A team space with a Board, Repo, and Pipeline starter setup
- Permissions based on your Azure AD or manually added users

📌 Best Practice:
- Set up **area paths** and **iteration paths** to reflect your delivery structure (e.g., Product Areas and Sprints)

## 🧠 Expert Insight

> Don’t let the tooling drive the process — let your **delivery goals and team culture** guide how you use Azure DevOps.

As a Delivery Lead:
- Focus on **removing blockers**, not just reporting them
- Use dashboards to drive **stand-ups, reviews, and retros**
- **Coach** the team to use the tools consistently, but not rigidly
