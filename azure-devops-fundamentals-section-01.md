## üéØ Course Goal

> Build confidence using Azure DevOps to plan, build, test, and release software. Learn how to bring structure, automation, and transparency to your development process.

Whether you're a developer, QA, or Delivery Lead, the goal is to:
- **Understand the tools**
- **Apply them to real delivery challenges**
- **Support teams through smoother, faster releases**

---

## üí° Why Should You Care About DevOps?

### üî• The Reality:
In today's delivery environments, it's not enough to just "build software." You need to:
- Release it **quickly**
- Maintain **quality**
- Support **collaboration** between Dev, QA, and Ops
- **Measure** your progress

That‚Äôs where **DevOps** comes in.

### üö´ Misconceptions:
| Myth                             | Reality                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚ÄúDevOps is just for developers.‚Äù | It‚Äôs for **the whole delivery team**: QA, Ops, and leadership too.     |
| ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre Agile, so we don‚Äôt need DevOps.‚Äù | Agile ‚â† automation. DevOps makes Agile **deliverable**.         |
| ‚ÄúDevOps is just tools.‚Äù          | It‚Äôs a **culture**, not just Jenkins and Git.                          |

### ‚úÖ Why It Matters to You
| Role          | Why DevOps Helps You                                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Delivery Lead | Better visibility, faster cycles, fewer escalations                        |
| Developers    | Faster feedback on code, fewer manual steps                                |
| QA            | Integration into pipelines, less friction with dev teams                   |
| Ops           | Predictable deployments, reduced production firefighting                   |

### üß† Mental Model:

## üîπ What is Azure DevOps?

**Azure DevOps** is Microsoft's platform for modern software delivery. It gives teams one unified space to:
- Plan and track work
- Host code in version control
- Automate build and release pipelines
- Manage tests and track quality
- Share and consume internal packages

üîé Unlike other toolchains that require 4‚Äì5 separate tools (e.g., Jira + GitHub + Jenkins + Artifactory), Azure DevOps brings all of these **into one secure environment.**

---

## üîπ Why Use Azure DevOps?

### üìå Business Value:
| Benefit             | How It Helps                                                          |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| One Source of Truth | Keeps planning, code, tests, and releases in sync                    |
| Faster Time to Value| Automate the slow, manual steps in testing and deployment            |
| Lower Risk          | Integrated quality gates prevent defects from reaching production    |
| Role Flexibility    | Tailored access for Dev, QA, Managers, and Contractors               |

### ü§ù Who Uses Azure DevOps?
- Small Agile teams
- Enterprise delivery teams with complex compliance needs
- Government and regulated industries
- Hybrid teams (on-prem + cloud)

## üîπ Core Components Overview

| Component           | Functionality Summary                                                | Example Use Case                                             |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Azure Boards**     | Plan work items, sprints, and Kanban boards                         | Track a new feature across several teams                     |
| **Azure Repos**      | Git-based version control with pull requests and branching           | Developers collaborating on a new module                     |
| **Azure Pipelines**  | CI/CD for automated builds, tests, and deployments                   | Run unit tests, build Docker images, deploy to staging       |
| **Azure Test Plans** | Manual and exploratory testing toolset                               | QA runs regression tests before release                      |
| **Azure Artifacts**  | Package manager for NuGet, npm, Maven, Python                        | Share a versioned API library across microservices teams     |

## üîπ DevOps vs Agile vs CI/CD

| Concept   | What It Really Means                                                             |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agile** | Helps us **plan and prioritize** smaller pieces of work for fast delivery         |
| **DevOps**| Helps us **collaborate and automate** delivery through shared ownership           |
| **CI/CD** | Helps us **build, test, and deploy** software more often with fewer risks         |

### üîÅ Analogy:
Think of Agile as **deciding what route to take**, DevOps as **tuning the engine**, and CI/CD as **the autopilot system** that drives it.

## üîπ Azure DevOps Roles ‚Äì Focus on Delivery Lead

As a **Delivery Lead**, Azure DevOps helps you:
- Visualize progress via **Boards and Dashboards**
- Track **team velocity, blockers, and cycle time**
- Surface build and test failures early via **Pipelines**
- Coordinate with QA on test coverage using **Test Plans**
- Use **Queries** to extract data for retros, reviews, or risk reports

### üìä Metrics You Can Drive:
| Metric               | Where to Get It       |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Lead Time            | From Boards + Pipelines |
| Deployment Frequency | From Pipelines         |
| Bug Fix Rate         | From Boards (Bug work items) |
| Sprint Completion    | From Boards Dashboards |

## üß† Expert Insight

> Azure DevOps succeeds when it's not just used by one team, but by the **whole delivery ecosystem** ‚Äî Dev, QA, PM, and Ops.

As a Delivery Lead:
- Think beyond the tools: focus on removing delays and creating **feedback loops**
- Don't be afraid to start small: even one good **pipeline** or **burndown chart** can change a team's habits
- Review pipeline failures like you'd review code ‚Äî they are as valuable as any bug
