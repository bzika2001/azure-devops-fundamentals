## üë• Adding Users and Permissions

1. Go to **Project Settings** > **Permissions**.
2. Add users (e.g., QA, Devs, Leads) to the project.
3. Assign roles like:
   - **Project Admin**
   - **Contributor**
   - **Reader**

üí° Use **Teams** for logical grouping (e.g., Frontend, Backend, QA).

## üóÇ Area Paths vs Iteration Paths

| Type             | Purpose                          | Example                         |
|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Area Path**    | Organizes work by feature/team   | `CustomerSupport > Mobile`      |
| **Iteration Path** | Organizes work by time/sprint | `2025 > Q3 > Sprint 1`          |

üìù Area Paths = "What", Iteration Paths = "When".

---

## üèÉ Define a Sprint

A **Sprint** is a fixed-length timebox (e.g., 2 weeks) during which the team delivers a set of committed work.

### Why Define Sprints?
- Sets delivery rhythm.
- Enables burndown tracking.
- Supports continuous delivery.

### How to Define Sprints:
1. **Project Settings** > **Boards** > **Project Configuration**.
2. Click **Iterations**.
3. Add your sprints:
   - Sprint 1: `2025-07-01` ‚Äì `2025-07-14`
   - Sprint 2: `2025-07-15` ‚Äì `2025-07-28`
4. Assign iterations to teams.

## üìã Azure Boards Overview

Use Azure Boards to:
- Plan (Epics ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Stories)
- Track (status, assignments)
- Prioritize (via backlogs and queries)

---

## üß± Work Item Types

Each work item helps organize delivery:

| Type       | Definition                                                                 |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Epic**   | Large body of work spanning multiple sprints and teams. High-level goal. |
| **Feature**| Grouping of user stories that deliver part of an Epic's value.            |
| **User Story** | Smallest unit of user functionality. Fits in one sprint.             |
| **Task**   | Technical step to implement a story. Owned by developers/testers.         |
| **Bug**    | A defect needing resolution.                                               |

### üß© Example Hierarchy:
Epic: Improve Customer Experience
‚îî‚îÄ Feature: Enhance Feedback Form
‚îú‚îÄ User Story: Add rating stars
‚îî‚îÄ User Story: Display thank-you message
‚îî‚îÄ Task: Create popup



üí° Epics help with quarterly planning. Stories help daily work.

## üìä Boards, Backlogs, and Sprints

Azure Boards is more than a task list ‚Äî it's your team‚Äôs visual delivery control panel. Understanding **Boards**, **Backlogs**, and **Sprints** will help your team stay aligned and deliver faster.

---

### üîπ Boards

Boards provide a **Kanban-style view** of work items. Each card on the board represents a work item (User Story, Bug, Task), and columns represent workflow stages like:

- **To Do**
- **Doing**
- **Code Review**
- **Done**

**Key uses:**
- Drag-and-drop to move work across columns
- Visualize bottlenecks (e.g., too much work stuck in ‚ÄúCode Review‚Äù)
- Customize per team or per work item type

üí° *Tip: Limit work-in-progress (WIP) to reduce context switching.*

---

### üîπ Backlogs

Backlogs give you a **prioritized list** of all your work items.

- **Epic Backlog**: See high-level initiatives.
- **Feature Backlog**: Break Epics into more focused deliverables.
- **Story Backlog**: Day-to-day developer tasks.

**Why it matters:**
- Helps the Product Owner or Delivery Manager focus on what matters next
- Allows grooming/refinement during the sprint
- Supports sprint planning with visibility of all work

üí° *Tip: Use backlog levels to zoom in/out from strategy to detail.*

---

### üîπ Sprints

A Sprint in Azure DevOps links directly to your Iteration Paths.

**Inside a Sprint view, you can:**
- Assign work items to the sprint
- View burndown charts
- Track capacity per team member
- Break stories into tasks

Sprint planning starts **from the Backlog**, moves into **Boards**, and is tracked through **Sprints**.

üìå *Use this flow:*
> Backlog grooming ‚Üí Sprint planning ‚Üí Sprint board tracking ‚Üí Sprint review & retro

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Component | Purpose | Key Benefit |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Boards** | Visual workflow | Team alignment, track status |
| **Backlogs** | Prioritized list | Plan future work, break down features |
| **Sprints** | Timebox delivery | Track velocity, deliver incrementally |

## üß† Expert Insight

> If you're managing a team, use **Boards** for visual tracking and reporting. Set up **Iteration Paths** before your sprint starts and link **Features** to your **Epics**. Focus on visualizing flow to improve team communication and delivery.
